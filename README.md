Create a sentence by selecting a word at random from each array in the following order:

<ol type="1">

 <li>article,</li>

 <li>noun,</li>

 <li>verb,</li>

 <li>preposition,</li>

 <li>article, and</li>

 <li>noun.</li>

</ol>

As each word is picked, concatenate it to the previous words in the sentence. The words must be separated by spaces. When the final sentence is output, it should start with a capital letter and end with a period. The application must generate and display 20 sentences.

<ul>

 <li>The article array must contain the articles “the,” “a,” “one,” “some,” and “any.”</li>

 <li>The noun array must contain the nouns “boy,” “girl,” “dog,” “town,” and “car.”</li>

 <li>The verb array must contain the verbs “drove,” “jumped,” “ran,” “walked,” and “skipped.”</li>

 <li>The preposition array must contain the prepositions “to,” “from,” “over,” “under” and “on.”</li>
